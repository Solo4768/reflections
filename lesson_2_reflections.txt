1.) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why fo you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository Git creates an empty Git repository in the current working directory. You need to initialize a repository because it will house all the files associated with each commit you create.

2.) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as an intermediary between the working directory and the repository. You are able to place files that you are ready to commit there while keeping files you are not yet ready to commit in the working directory.
